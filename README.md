## Overview
This project involves analyzing a Spotify dataset with various attributes about tracks, albums, and artists using **SQL**. It covers an end-to-end process of normalizing a denormalized dataset, performing SQL queries of varying complexity easy, medium, and advanced. The primary goal of the project is to practice advanced SQL skills and generate valuable insights from the dataset.

```SQL
-- Create Table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS spotify;
CREATE TABLE spotify (
    artist VARCHAR(255),
    track VARCHAR(255),
    album VARCHAR(255),
    album_type VARCHAR(50),
    danceability FLOAT,
    energy FLOAT,
    loudness FLOAT,
    speechiness FLOAT,
    acousticness FLOAT,
    instrumentalness FLOAT,
    liveness FLOAT,
    valence FLOAT,
    tempo FLOAT,
    duration_min FLOAT,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    channel VARCHAR(255),
    views FLOAT,
    likes BIGINT,
    comments BIGINT,
    licensed BOOLEAN,
    official_video BOOLEAN,
    stream BIGINT,
    energy_liveness FLOAT,
    most_played_on VARCHAR(50)
);
```
## Steps Performed :

### 1. Data Exploration
Before diving into SQL, itâ€™s important to understand the dataset thoroughly. The dataset contains attributes such as:
- `Artist`: The performer of the track.
- `Track`: The name of the song.
- `Album`: The album to which the track belongs.
- `Album_type`: The type of album (e.g., single or album).
- Various metrics such as `danceability`, `energy`, `loudness`, `tempo`, and more.

### 2. Querying the Data
After the data is inserted, various SQL queries can be written to explore and analyze the data. Queries are categorized into **easy**, **medium**, and **advanced** levels to help progressively develop SQL proficiency.

#### Easy Queries
- Simple data retrieval, filtering, and basic aggregations.
  
#### Medium Queries
- More complex queries involving grouping, aggregation functions, and joins.
  
#### Advanced Queries
- Nested subqueries, window functions, and CTEs.

## Questions

### Easy Level
1. **Retrieve the names of all tracks that have more than 1 billion streams.**
	```SQL
 		SELECT * FROM spotify
		WHERE stream > 1000000000
 	```
2. **List all albums along with their respective artists.**
   	```SQL
    		SELECT 
			DISTINCT album, artist
		FROM spotify
		ORDER BY 1
    ```
3. **Get the total number of comments for tracks where `licensed = TRUE`.**
   	```SQL
    		SELECT 
			SUM(comments) as total_comments
		FROM spotify
		WHERE licensed = 'true'
    ```
4. **Find all tracks that belong to the album type `single`.**
   	```SQL
    		SELECT * FROM spotify
		WHERE album_type ILIKE 'single'
    ```
5. **Count the total number of tracks by each artist.**
   	```SQL
    		SELECT 
			artist,
			COUNT(*) as total_songs
		FROM spotify
		GROUP BY artist
		ORDER BY 2
    ```

### Medium Level
1. **Calculate the average danceability of tracks in each album.**
   	```SQL
    		SELECT 
			album,
			AVG(danceability) as avg_danceability
		FROM spotify
		GROUP BY 1
		ORDER BY 2
	```
2. **Find the top 5 tracks with the highest energy values.**
   	```SQL
    		SELECT 
			track,
			MAX(energy)
		FROM spotify
		GROUP BY 1
		ORDER BY 2 DESC
		LIMIT 5
	```
3. **List all tracks along with their views and likes where `official_video = TRUE`.**
   ```SQL
    		SELECT 
			track,
			SUM(views) as total_views,
			SUM(likes) as total_likes
		FROM spotify
		WHERE official_video = 'true'
		GROUP BY 1
		ORDER BY 2
	```

4. **For each album, calculate the total views of all associated tracks.**
```SQL
 		SELECT 
			album,
			track,
			SUM(views)
		FROM spotify
		GROUP BY 1, 2
		ORDER BY 3
```
 
5. **Retrieve the track names that have been streamed on Spotify more than YouTube.**
```SQL
 		SELECT * FROM
		(SELECT 
	 		track,
	 		COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN most_played_on = 'Youtube' THEN stream END),0) as streamed_on_youtube,
	 		COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN most_played_on = 'Spotify' THEN stream END),0) as streamed_on_spotify
		FROM spotify
		GROUP BY 1
		) AS t1
		WHERE 
			streamed_on_spotify > streamed_on_youtube
			AND
			streamed_on_youtube <> 0
```

### Advanced Level
1. **Find the top 3 most-viewed tracks for each artist using window functions.**
   ```SQL
    		WITH ranking_artist
		AS
		(SELECT 
			artist,
			track,
			SUM(views) AS total_view,
			DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY artist ORDER BY SUM(views) DESC) AS rank
		FROM spotify
		GROUP BY 1,2
		ORDER BY 1,3 DESC
		)
		SELECT * FROM ranking_artist
		WHERE rank <= 3
    	```
2. **Write a query to find tracks where the liveness score is above the average.**
```SQL
 		SELECT 
			track,
			artist,
			liveness
		FROM spotify
		WHERE liveness > (SELECT AVG(liveness) FROM spotify)
```	
3. **Use a `WITH` clause to calculate the difference between the highest and lowest energy values for tracks in each album.**
```SQL
		WITH cte
		AS
		(SELECT 
			album,
			MAX(energy) as highest_energy,
			MIN(energy) as lowest_energery
		FROM spotify
		GROUP BY 1
		)
		SELECT 
			album,
			highest_energy - lowest_energery as energy_diff
		FROM cte
		ORDER BY 2 DESC
```
4. **Find tracks where the energy-to-liveness ratio is greater than 1.2.**
```SQL
 		SELECT 
			track,
			energy/liveness AS energy_to_liveness_ratio
		FROM spotify
		WHERE energy/liveness > 1.2
```
5. **Calculate the cumulative sum of likes for tracks ordered by the number of views, using window functions.**
```SQL
 		SELECT 
			track,
			SUM(likes) OVER(ORDER BY views) AS cumulative_sum
		FROM spotify
		ORDER BY 2 DESC
```
